                <p>Some people go to the gym to get fit, some people go to the gym to socialize with friends, some people go to the gym to lose weight. Matthew Harrington went to the gym because his wife told him to. A self-proclaimed workaholic, Matt put in long hours and sacrificed his well-being with poor diet, long work hours, and no exercise. With the support of his wife, he has changed his life to one of healthy living and healthy eating.</p>
                <p>For the seven years that my wife and I have been married, we have probably only spent half of those years together. As a father to young twins, I felt that a father's job, just like my father and his father, was to be always working, sacrificing our own wellbeing so our families can have the best of everything. I worked around the world on ships with no gym for months at a time, 14hrs a day, seven days a week, starting at midnight. When I was home, my wife and I ran a very successful restaurant in Vung Tau and worked there for up to 18 hours a day. Normal family life did not exist. As soon as I was home from my work offshore, I would already have the next two jobs lined up ready and waiting, usually with only a few days' rest between. </p>
                <p>Restaurant life was based around a lot of eating, drinking and smoking, with most days consisting of huge unhealthy meals, a bottle of Jack Daniels and 24 cans of Coke. We were not eating food; we were eating something that resembled food. We ate chips, sweets and didn't drink a single glass of water for weeks.</p>

                <p>Some people go to the gym to get fit, some people go to the gym to socialize with friends, some people go to the gym to lose weight. Matthew Harrington went to the gym because his wife told him to. A self-proclaimed workaholic, Matt put in long hours and sacrificed his well-being with poor diet, long work hours, and no exercise. With the support of his wife, he has changed his life to one of healthy living and healthy eating.</p>
                <p>For the seven years that my wife and I have been married, we have probably only spent half of those years together. As a father to young twins, I felt that a father's job, just like my father and his father, was to be always working, sacrificing our own wellbeing so our families can have the best of everything. I worked around the world on ships with no gym for months at a time, 14hrs a day, seven days a week, starting at midnight. When I was home, my wife and I ran a very successful restaurant in Vung Tau and worked there for up to 18 hours a day. Normal family life did not exist. As soon as I was home from my work offshore, I would already have the next two jobs lined up ready and waiting, usually with only a few days' rest between. </p>
                <p>Restaurant life was based around a lot of eating, drinking and smoking, with most days consisting of huge unhealthy meals, a bottle of Jack Daniels and 24 cans of Coke. We were not eating food; we were eating something that resembled food. We ate chips, sweets and didn't drink a single glass of water for weeks.</p>
