<h3>DJ</h3>
<h4>GROUP X COORDINATOR</h4>
<p>'I love to share my passion for dance. When the music makes your body move, your feet jam, and you just can’t stop the pulsating vibration flowing through your body, that’s what I call the Sensation of Dance. It’s inspiring to see my students having FUN, being happy, working hard, becoming healthier, and enjoying life.' </p>
<p></p>
<p>Bio:<br>
DJ has practiced form since the age of 5. His first mentor, his father, is a master of martial arts who taught DJ to train hard, to keep his head up when he loses, to be humble when he wins and - above all - to never give up. DJ was a Youth Champion (2001-2005) in the Vietnam traditional martial arts union (Ho Chi Minh, Binh Thuan, Nghe An, Binh Dinh, Quang Ngai) and went on to become a National Champion in Vietnam traditional martial arts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>DJ discovered his passion for dance when he was 15 years old. He has over seven years of experience in choreography and performance as a hip-hop dancer. DJ loves to work out, challenge himself, and discover his abilities in fitness and sport. He continues to learn new styles of dance and strives to become a great dancer as part of his life's journey.</p>

<h3>GENESIS</h3>
<h4>GROUP X INSTRUCTOR</h4>
<p>Dancing is my Passion, it is my Life. I like creating new moves, perfecting skills and experimenting with different genres of dance. I want my students to feel that they can be themselves inside the class; that it is their time to sweat out all their stress or to just be crazy and dance their hearts out like there is no one watching. Surrounded with cool music in a high cardio dance workout is an exhilarating way to burn calories and achieve the fitness level we all desire. </p>

<p>Bio:<br>
Genesis has been practicing his craft for 18 years and has been a Group X Instructor for 6 years. Being a member of the Philippine Aerobics/Gymnastics Team had a very important role in enhancing his talents in dancing. He appreciates the guidance of his mentors and considers sharing the stage and teaching with Gandalf Archer, Program Director of Les Mills Body Jam as one of his greatest achievements. He enjoys being just a regular guy who spends the whole day just listening to music while he does his chores.</p>
