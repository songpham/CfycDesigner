I love knowing how to take care of my body and helping my friends and family learn the value of health and fitness. CFYC opened my mind to the importance of health by integrating fitness into my daily life. I will definitely stay with CFYC as I continue my journey ahead. ');

define('LANG_CELEBRITY_MEMBERS_HOANG_MY',' In my opinion, working out with a personal trainer is the most effective method for staying in shape. The trainer not only helps you understand your strengths and weaknesses, but also recommends more efficient exercises. Professional Trainer Al Morgan was excellent – he knows exactly how to motivate his clients and alternate his routines to make workouts more interesting. Exercising is also mind training, and may be hard for those who are not willing to suffer a little pain. I discovered I like Mixed Martial Arts. It helps me keep fit and, moreover, protect myself if necessary.<br><br>
 
I have noticed three amazing things since I started working out at CFYC. First, my body shape has changed dramatically – I’m more toned with more sexy, dynamic curves. Second, my flexibility and agility has improved, helping me work harder and keep pursuing my dream. Last, my mindset has become much stronger.
