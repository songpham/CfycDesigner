Working out develops discipline and trains my mind to identify my goals, as well as giving me the determination to accomplish them. As a result, I won the Vietnam Super Model Contest in 2012. I changed my life when I stopped staying out late and began a healthier lifestyle: reading books and learning new skills like how to cook nutritious food. I love knowing how to take care of my body and helping my friends and family learn the value of health and fitness. CFYC opened my mind to the importance of health by integrating fitness into my daily life. I will definitely stay with CFYC as I continue my journey ahead. ');
