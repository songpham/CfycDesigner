<h3>GENESIS</h3>
<h4>GROUP X INSTRUCTOR</h4>
<p>Dancing is my Passion, it is my Life. I like creating new moves, perfecting skills and experimenting with different genres of dance. I want my students to feel that they can be themselves inside the class; that it is their time to sweat out all their stress or to just be crazy and dance their hearts out like there is no one watching. Surrounded with cool music in a high cardio dance workout is an exhilarating way to burn calories and achieve the fitness level we all desire. </p>

<p>Bio:<br>
Genesis has been practicing his craft for 18 years and has been a Group X Instructor for 6 years. Being a member of the Philippine Aerobics/Gymnastics Team had a very important role in enhancing his talents in dancing. He appreciates the guidance of his mentors and considers sharing the stage and teaching with Gandalf Archer, Program Director of Les Mills Body Jam as one of his greatest achievements. He enjoys being just a regular guy who spends the whole day just listening to music while he does his chores.</p>
