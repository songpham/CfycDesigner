        <p>Regular fitness keeps me healthy both physically and mentally! I had no idea what kind of world I was getting into when I changed my lifestyle to a more fit and healthy one, but I'm thankful I did. Here are a few ways fitness changed my life for the better.</p>
        <p>1. It helped me kick bad habits. I would come home, get into workout gear, push myself and grab for water instead of vodka. </p>
        <p>2. My competition is myself. We live in a society where we constantly compare ourselves to others. What I love about fitness is that your competition is yourself. You always want to do better than you did the last time. </p>
        <p>3. My best ideas are a result of a good workout. I have had more 'A-HA!' moments while in the gym than anywhere else.</p>
        <p>4. I crave better foods. Just like how I no longer craved alcohol at the end of every day, when I started exercising more, I began to crave healthier foods. </p>
        <p>5. I'm more motivated. There's something about reaching small goals that motivates you in other areas in your life as well. The more goals I make through fitness, the more goals I want to make in other areas of my life. Fitness helps improve my career, my relationships and my overall outlook on life. </p>
        <p>6. I'm capable. The more I work on getting stronger, the more I can do physically. </p>
        <p>7. I have a can do attitude. Knowing I can reach my fitness goals gives me an I-can-do-anything attitude that is much needed when I feel down. </p>
        <p>8. I look good.</p>

        <p>Trang met some difficulties in work and communication because of her appearance (fat body). She looked through some fitness centre in Hanoi and finally found California the best.

        <p>Mr. Ha is inconfident about his appearance, he used to play sports (basketball, volleyball, swimming,...) and trained at Fitness Centres in Malaysia on his studying. However, he did not reach the desired result, because there was no suitable training environment which helped him constantly follow the routine. Joining California Fitness & Yoga Club, he has been competing with other trainees, which inspired him to exercise regularly. He prefers bootcamps because they provide him with the feeling of being connected on the training and encouraged him to keep up with others. As a result, Ha reduced 14kg of fat, increased 1kg of muscle, became more confident, and was ready for everyday activities.</p> ');
